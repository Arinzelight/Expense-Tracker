## Expense Tracker
Expense Tracker is a simple web application that helps you keep track of your income and expenses. You can add and remove items, and your data will be saved to local storage for easy access. This project is a practical way to manage your finances and monitor your spending.

## Project Specifications
Expense Tracker is built with the following specifications in mind:

- Create UI for project: The user interface (UI) is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Users should be able to easily understand how to use the application.

- Display transaction items in DOM: All transactions, including income and expenses, will be displayed in the Document Object Model (DOM). This provides users with a clear view of their financial history.

- Show balance, expense, and income totals: The application calculates and displays the current balance, total expenses, and total income. Users can quickly see their financial status at a glance.

- Add new transaction and reflect in total: Users can add new transactions, specifying whether it's an income or an expense. The application will automatically update the totals accordingly.

- Delete items from DOM: If users want to remove a transaction, they can easily delete it from the DOM. This action will also update the totals.

- Persist to local storage: All transaction data is saved to local storage. This means that even if the user closes the application or refreshes the page, their financial data will be preserved.

## How to Use
1. Accessing the Application: You can access the Expense Tracker by opening the index.html file in your web browser. There's no need to install anything or set up a server.

2. Adding Transactions: To add a new transaction, click the "Add Transaction" button. You'll be prompted to enter a description, specify whether it's an income or expense, and enter the amount. Click "Add Transaction" again to confirm.

3. Deleting Transactions: To delete a transaction, simply click the "X" button next to the transaction in the list. This will remove it from the DOM and update the totals.

4. Viewing Totals: The current balance, total expenses, and total income are displayed at the top of the application. These values will automatically update as you add or delete transactions.

5. Local Storage: Your transaction data is automatically saved to local storage. This means that if you close the application and reopen it later, your financial history will still be there.
